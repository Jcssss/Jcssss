### Hi there, I'm Justin. Thanks for stopping by! 😄

Here's a little about me...
I'm a Data Science student 💻📊 with a passion for building applications that enable users to learn 📚, understand 💡, and create 🛠️. When I'm not programming, you'll often find me playing badminton 🏸 or crocheting 🧶.

Here are some of my most recent projects:

| Title | Tools/Languages | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Last Light | Unity, C# | A 2D Platformer in which the player and their companion, Pixie, must navigate through the darkness of a lighthouse, all while fending off an endless horde of monsters. |
