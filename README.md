### Hi there, I'm Justin. Thanks for stopping by! 😄

Here's a little about me...
I'm a Data Science student 💻📊 with a passion for building applications that enable users to learn 📚, understand 💡, and create 🛠️. When I'm not programming, you'll often find me playing badminton 🏸 or crocheting 🧶.

Here are some of my most recent projects:

| Title | Tools/Languages | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Last Light | Unity, C# | A 2D Platformer created in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 54 Game Jam |
| TFT Team Builder | React, HTML, CSS, Javascript | A responsive website, allowing users to plan and organize their teams for the video game Teamfight Tactics |
