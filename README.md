### Hi there, I'm Justin. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜„

Here's a little about me...
I'm a Data Science student with a passion for building applications that enable users to learn, understand, and create. When I'm not programming in my spare time, you'll often find me playing badminton or crocheting.

Here are some of my most recent projects:
1. Last Light
   A 2D Platformer where the player must control a pixie in order to avoid monsters, activate platforms, and escape the darkness of the lighthouse. I, along with a team of 6 others, submitted this game for Ludum Dare 54, the world's largest Game Jam!
