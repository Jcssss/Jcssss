### Hi there, I'm Justin. Thanks for stopping by! 😄

Here's a little about me...
I'm a Data Science student 💻📊 with a passion for building applications that enable users to learn 📚, understand 💡, and create 🛠️. When I'm not programming in my spare time, you'll often find me playing badminton 🏸 or crocheting 🧶.

Here are some of my most recent projects:
1. Last Light\
   A 2D Platformer where the player must control a pixie in order to avoid monsters, activate platforms, and escape the darkness of the lighthouse. I, along with a team of 6 others, submitted this game for Ludum Dare 54, the world's largest Game Jam!
